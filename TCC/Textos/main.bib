abstract="Inspection of power transmission lines is often a highly hazardous activity, subject to uncertainties due to the system and environmental characteristics. The present study aims to develop a mobile robot to inspect transmission lines. The development process encompasses a series of fundamental steps. Initially, a highly realistic simulation environment is created, containing an authentic section of a transmission line. Subsequently, the simulated robot is designed and equipped with a camera and LIDAR sensor to inspect the simulated transmission line. Once the simulation results are validated, the real prototype of the robot is materialized. This approach allows for a precise evaluation of the robot's performance, enabling necessary adjustments and enhancements to ensure the effectiveness of transmission line inspection. The prototype consists of a robotic gripper capable of conducting preventive and predictive inspections in transmission lines.",
